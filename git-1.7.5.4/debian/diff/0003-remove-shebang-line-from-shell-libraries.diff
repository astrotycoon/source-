Subject: [PATCH 3/6] remove shebang line from shell libraries

As v1.7.0-rc1~9 (2009-11-25) explained, even if a script is expected
to be sourced instead of executed on its own, the #!/bin/sh line
provides simple documentation about what format the file is in.

Now that these files are not marked executable, though, the lack of
such a line is not confusing the valgrind support of our test scripts.
To be even more self-documenting, add some text explaining that these
are shell libraries and remove the #!.

Noticed by lintian.  This patch is Debian-specific for now.
