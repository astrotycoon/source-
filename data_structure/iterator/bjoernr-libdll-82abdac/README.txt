libdll is a small and portable, yet feature rich doubly linked list
implementation in C. 

This library has been written with (embedded) Linux as a target operating system
in mind but since it's all just a few lines of ANSI C libdll is trivial to port.

For installation instructions have a look at INSTALL.txt.

API documentation in HTML format can be found in the doc directory. Also,
test/dll_testcase.c provides quite a lot of example code.
