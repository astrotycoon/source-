Here's some instructions (interwoven with notes to myself) on how to build and
install libdll.

1. Create Makefiles

    Install cmake (http://www.cmake.org/) if you haven't got it already.
    
    If you want to install into a non-standard location you can modify the
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake cache entry to change the destination using the
    following cmake parameter:

        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/libdll

    If you want a Debug build of libdll you can specify 

        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug

    on cmake's commandline. Make sure you have cunit
    (http://cunit.sourceforge.net/) installed though, as an additional unit test
    binary will be created as well.

    I tend to use clang (http://clang.llvm.org) quite often lately, this is how
    I tell cmake which C-compiler to use (entirely optional if you don't care):

        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=clang

    I would suggest building out of tree, so make yourself a build directory
    somewhere:

        mkdir build
        cd build

    Finally run cmake with any of the above options an the path to libdll's
    source directory:

        cmake [OPTS] /path/to/libdll/src/

2. Build
    
        make

    Running make in your build directory will build the shared libdll library
    and optionally (in a Debug build) a 'dlltest' binary which runs some unit
    tests against the library.

3. Install

        make install

    There is no need to install if for instance you just want to run dlltest.
    cmake will set everything up accordingly. Just go ahead and run test/dlltest
    from the build direcotry. I would suggest to do so before installing anyway. 

4. Update you dynamic linker's runtime bindings so it can find libdll (see e.g.
   man ldconfig on Linux).
