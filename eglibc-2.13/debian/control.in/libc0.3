Description: Embedded GNU C Library: PIC archive library
 Contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
 This is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used on the Debian
 boot floppies. If you are not making your own set of Debian boot floppies
 using the `boot-floppies' package, you probably don't need this package.

 and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This package contains a minimal set of libraries needed for the Debian
 installer.  Do not install it on a normal system.
